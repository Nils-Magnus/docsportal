On top of the screen, in the Magenta bar, there's a menu for extra
information services such as the "Event History" and the "Component
Availability". For details see the sections below.

If an incident or a maintenance is active, one or more boxes in the
top region provide an overview of the current situation and the next
planned actions. More details are available if you click on the
incident title.

The platform supports multiple regions. Next is the selector of the
geographic regions of the Open Telekom Cloud (e.g., "EU-DE" for
Germany or "EU-NL" for the Netherlands). To switch the region, click
on the tab, respectively.

Grouped by categories (Compute, Network, Storage, ...), the body
section displays the current state for each service.

Service Status
--------------

Services are categorized into sections such as Compute, Network, or
Storage. Each service comes with an icon, also known as a
semaphore. Click on the icons to find out more about the
incident. This way you will find latest updates issued by the service
manager for the ongoing resolution progress, further investigations,
mitigation plans, and timelines. The service manager announces when a
next update is planned.
